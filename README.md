# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to build a website that will allow for a easier study process.
- Whe built this to learn the steps involved into creating a project and also to solve an issue
- It solves the problem involved with studying but not having everthing laid out an a easy to read format.
- I learned the foundations to coding, HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I learned how the HTML is the frame, CSS is the web style, and JavaScript makes it all functional.
